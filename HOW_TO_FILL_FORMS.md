## Why "Please navigate to a Google Form first" Error Appears

This error appears when:

1. **You're not on a Google Form page**
   - The extension only works on Google Forms
   - Make sure the URL contains `docs.google.com/forms` or `forms.gle`

2. **The form hasn't loaded yet**
   - Wait a few seconds for the page to fully load
   - Refresh the page and try again

3. **You're on the wrong type of form**
   - The extension only works on Google Forms
   - It doesn't work on other form platforms (Microsoft Forms, Typeform, etc.)

4. **URL Check Issue (Technical)**
   - The extension checks if the URL contains specific strings
   - If the URL format is different, it might not detect it

## Common Google Form URLs

The extension works on these URL formats:
- ✅ `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/...`
- ✅ `https://docs.google.com/forms/u/0/d/...`
- ✅ `https://forms.gle/...`
- ✅ `https://forms.google.com/...` (if redirected from forms.gle)

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Please navigate to a Google Form first"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure you're on a Google Form (check the URL)
2. The URL should contain `docs.google.com/forms` or `forms.gle`
3. Refresh the page
4. Try clicking "Fill All Fields" again

### Form Not Filling

**Possible causes:**
1. Profile data not filled - Go to Settings and fill your profile
2. Fields don't match - Some form fields might not match your profile fields
3. Form is read-only - Some forms don't allow auto-filling
4. Form hasn't loaded - Wait for the form to fully load

**Solution:**
1. Use "Preview & Edit" to see which fields will be filled
2. Check your profile has the required data
3. Try refreshing the page
4. Manually fill fields that didn't auto-fill

### Extension Icon Not Showing

**Solution:**
1. Click the Extensions icon (puzzle piece 🧩) in Chrome toolbar
2. Find "Filleasy"
3. Click the pin icon (📌) to pin it
4. Icon should appear in toolbar

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Complete Your Profile**: More complete profile = better field matching
2. **Use Preview First**: Always preview before filling important forms
3. **Check Field Names**: Form field names should match common patterns (First Name, Email, etc.)
4. **Manual Corrections**: Some fields may need manual adjustment
5. **Multi-page Forms**: Fill each page separately

## Example Workflow

1. ✅ Fill out your profile in Settings
2. ✅ Open a Google Form
3. ✅ Click Filleasy icon
4. ✅ Click "Fill All Fields"
5. ✅ Review filled data
